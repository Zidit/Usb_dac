USB DAC
=======
Basic external sound card based on Texas Instrument's PCM2706 USB DAC. The sound card has build in headphone amplifier based on NwAvGuy's [O2](http://nwavguy.blogspot.fi/2011/08/o2-details.html) design. It also has two line outputs and optical s/pdif output. All line and headphone outputs have individual volume control on front.
The amplifier needs external power supply to work. Power supply must provide 12 V to 16 V AC and at least 200 mA of current. There is also option to skip all amplification circuitry and drive headphone output directly from PCM2706. This way you don't need external power, but you lose line outputs and volume control.
